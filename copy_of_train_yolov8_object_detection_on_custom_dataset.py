Ultralytics YOLOv8 is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and image segmentation model developed by Ultralytics. The YOLOv8 model is designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection and image segmentation tasks. It can be trained on large datasets and is capable of running on a variety of hardware platforms, from CPUs to GPUs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

YOLOv8 is still under heavy development. Breaking changes are being introduced almost weekly. We strive to make our YOLOv8 notebooks work with the latest version of the library. Last tests took place on **03.01.2024** with version **YOLOv8.0.196**.

If you notice that our notebook behaves incorrectly - especially if you experience errors that prevent you from going through the tutorial - don't hesitate! Let us know and open an [issue](https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks/issues) on the Roboflow Notebooks repository.

## Accompanying Blog Post

We recommend that you follow along in this notebook while reading the blog post on how to train YOLOv8 Object Detection, concurrently.

## Pro Tip: Use GPU Acceleration

If you are running this notebook in Google Colab, navigate to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` -> `Hardware accelerator`, set it to `GPU`, and then click `Save`. This will ensure your notebook uses a GPU, which will significantly speed up model training times.

## Steps in this Tutorial

In this tutorial, we are going to cover:

- Before you start
- Install YOLOv8
- CLI Basics
- Inference with Pre-trained COCO Model
- Roboflow Universe
- Preparing a custom dataset
- Custom Training
- Validate Custom Model
- Inference with Custom Model

**Let's begin!**

## Before you start

Let's make sure that we have access to GPU. We can use `nvidia-smi` command to do that. In case of any problems navigate to `Edit` -> `Notebook settings` -> `Hardware accelerator`, set it to `GPU`, and then click `Save`.

"""## CLI Basics

If you want to train, validate or run inference on models and don't need to make any modifications to the code, using YOLO command line interface is the easiest way to get started. Read more about CLI in [Ultralytics YOLO Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli/).

```
yolo task=detect    mode=train    model=yolov8n.yaml      args...
          classify       predict        yolov8n-cls.yaml  args...

                         export         yolov8n.pt        format=onnx  args...
```

## Inference with Pre-trained COCO Model

### üíª CLI

`yolo mode=predict` runs YOLOv8 inference on a variety of sources, downloading models automatically from the latest YOLOv8 release, and saving results to `runs/predict`.

"""## Roboflow Universe

Need data for your project? Before spending time on annotating, check out Roboflow Universe, a repository of more than 110,000 open-source datasets that you can use in your projects. You'll find datasets containing everything from annotated cracks in concrete to plant images with disease annotations.


[![Roboflow Universe](https://media.roboflow.com/notebooks/template/uni-banner-frame.png?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1672878480290)](https://universe.roboflow.com/)

## Preparing a custom¬†dataset

Building a custom dataset can be a painful process. It might take dozens or even hundreds of hours to collect images, label them, and export them in the proper format. Fortunately, Roboflow makes this process as straightforward and fast as possible. Let me show you how!

### Step 1: Creating project

Before you start, you need to create a Roboflow [account](https://app.roboflow.com/login). Once you do that, you can create a new project in the Roboflow [dashboard](https://app.roboflow.com/). Keep in mind to choose the right project type. In our case, Object Detection.

<div align="center">

    src="https://media.roboflow.com/preparing-custom-dataset-example/creating-project.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1672929799852"
  >
</div>

### Step 2: Uploading images

Next, add the data to your newly created project. You can do it via API or through our [web interface](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/object-detection).

If you drag and drop a directory with a dataset in a supported format, the Roboflow dashboard will automatically read the images and annotations together.

<div align="center">
  <img
    width="640"
    src="https://media.roboflow.com/preparing-custom-dataset-example/uploading-images.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1672929808290"
  >
</div>

### Step 3: Labeling

If you only have images, you can label them in [Roboflow Annotate](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate).

<div align="center">
  <img
    width="640"
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26109316/210901980-04861efd-dfc0-4a01-9373-13a36b5e1df4.gif"
  >
</div>

### Step 4: Generate new dataset version

Now that we have our images and annotations added, we can Generate a Dataset Version. When Generating a Version, you may elect to add preprocessing and augmentations. This step is completely optional, however, it can allow you to significantly improve the robustness of your model.

<div align="center">
  <img
    width="640"
    src="https://media.roboflow.com/preparing-custom-dataset-example/generate-new-version.gif?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1673003597834"
  >
</div>

### Step 5: Exporting dataset

Once the dataset version is generated, we have a hosted dataset we can load directly into our notebook for easy training. Click `Export` and select the `YOLO v5 PyTorch` dataset format.

"""## Deploy model on Roboflow

Once you have finished training your YOLOv8 model, you‚Äôll have a set of trained weights ready for use. These weights will be in the `/runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt` folder of your project. You can upload your model weights to Roboflow Deploy to use your trained weights on our infinitely scalable infrastructure.

The `.deploy()` function in the [Roboflow pip package](https://docs.roboflow.com/python) now supports uploading YOLOv8 weights.

To upload model weights, add the following code to the ‚ÄúInference with Custom Model‚Äù section in the aforementioned notebook:
"""

project.version(dataset.version).deploy(model_type="yolov8", model_path=f"{HOME}/runs/detect/train/")

#While your deployment is processing, checkout the deployment docs to take your model to most destinations https://docs.roboflow.com/inference

#Run inference on your model on a persistant, auto-scaling, cloud API

#load model
model = project.version(dataset.version).model

#choose random test set image
import os, random
test_set_loc = dataset.location + "/test/images/"
random_test_image = random.choice(os.listdir(test_set_loc))
print("running inference on " + random_test_image)

pred = model.predict(test_set_loc + random_test_image, confidence=40, overlap=30).json()
pred

"""# Deploy Your Model to the Edge

In addition to using the Roboflow hosted API for deployment, you can use [Roboflow Inference](https://inference.roboflow.com), an open source inference solution that has powered millions of API calls in production environments. Inference works with CPU and GPU, giving you immediate access to a range of devices, from the NVIDIA Jetson to TRT-compatible devices to ARM CPU devices.

With Roboflow Inference, you can self-host and deploy your model on-device. You can deploy applications using the [Inference Docker containers](https://inference.roboflow.com/quickstart/docker/) or the pip package.

For example, to install Inference on a device with an NVIDIA GPU, we can use:

```
docker pull roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu
```

Then we can run inference via HTTP:

```python
import requests

workspace_id = ""
model_id = ""
image_url = ""
confidence = 0.75
api_key = ""

infer_payload = {
    "image": {
        "type": "url",
        "value": image_url,
    },
    "confidence": confidence,
    "iou_threshold": iou_thresh,
    "api_key": api_key,
}
res = requests.post(
    f"http://localhost:9001/{workspace_id}/{model_id}",
    json=infer_object_detection_payload,
)

predictions = res.json()
```

Above, set your Roboflow workspace ID, model ID, and API key.

- [Find your workspace and model ID](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/workspace-and-project-ids?ref=blog.roboflow.com)
- [Find your API key](https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication?ref=blog.roboflow.com#retrieve-an-api-key)

Also, set the URL of an image on which you want to run inference. This can be a local file.

_To use your YOLOv5 model commercially with Inference, you will need a Roboflow Enterprise license, through which you gain a pass-through license for using YOLOv5. An enterprise license also grants you access to features like advanced device management, multi-model containers, auto-batch inference, and more._
